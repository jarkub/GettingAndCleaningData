# GettingAndCleaningData
Final project for Getting and Cleaning Data course from JHU and Coursera

The script run.analysis.R will download the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0" [1]. It joins the training and testing sets of data into a single dataset, selects only mean (mean()) and standard devation (std()) transformation variables. The results dataset tidy.txt includes the mean for each variable with the data grouped by subject id and activity.
